The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps. The app supports its users in detecting malicious links: QR Codes provide new possibilities for an attacker, as QR Codes can contain malicious links, i.e. links to phishing webpages or webpages from which malware would automatically be downloaded. Therefore it is important to carefully check the link before accessing the corresponding webpage.

This app is optimized regarding the user's privacy. It only uses the device's camera in order to decode QR codes and barcodes.
