## [Privacy Friendly QR Scanner v1.4](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-qr-scanner/releases/tag/v1.4) - 2015-10-02

The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner supports its users in detecting malicious links: QR Codes provide new possibilities for an attacker, as QR Codes can contain malicious links, i.e. links to phishing webpages or webpages from which malware would automatically be downloaded. Therefore it is important to carefully check the link before accessing the corresponding webpage.

This app is optimized regarding the user's privacy. It only uses the device's camera in order to decode QR codes and barcodes.
It belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps from the research group SecUSo (Security, Usability and Society) by the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.
